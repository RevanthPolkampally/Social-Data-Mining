0,"We are currently doing our research into the possibility of getting a Tesla and weighing all the factors into such a major purchase. Last Friday I came in and chatted with Rotex who is one of the customer representatives. He answered all my questions with a zero pressure feel, which I appreciated. Our family is considering either the model 3 or the Y, however we were concerned over whether it would fit in our garage in the City. He mentioned that he can answer that question easily by doing a garage fit. It's only specific to SF customers since our old houses have sometimes challenging garages. He said he can come over today, Monday to do the fit. He called 45 mins before the appointment to insure there would be no issues on our meeting time which was very considerate.He arrived and easily fit in the garage and went over some interesting features on the car. I was also concerned over cargo room and prepared a large roller, 22 inch carry on and a stroller and asked him if I can try to fit it on the trunk. He was very accommodating and we both figured out how it would fit. It swallowed it up with room to spare.At least we know that we can go with either model, and if we go smaller, we won't have to worry about not enough room.He said if I had any questions and if we want to set up a road test, just call him.I have to say this was a refreshingly nice experience and it only makes it easier to go with this super innovative company.Great job Tesla.",0.9889,0.015,0.827,0.158,Positive,Tesla
1,"This dealership has owed me $21,000 for the past 4 months. It's outrageous. I bought a car partially financed back in June and then decided I wanted a different color. So I took advantage of their 7-day return policy and returned the first car. Then I decided to lease instead. They told me that it might take a month or two to receive the refund for the first car, which sounded a little bit long to me. But I waited. After 2 months I started calling the dealership and Tesla finance to inquire about the $21K. Sometimes they would tell me that the check is in the mail. Sometimes they made it sound like they had lost the car! Nobody ever got back to me, despite promising to. I eventually wrote a threatening letter to Tesla corporate and that seemed to prompt some action. They had me come in a month ago to sign some DMV paperwork they had forgotten to have me sign before. Yet, they couldn't tell me when I would receive my refund. Nobody is returning my calls at this point. This experience has been so painful that I'm thinking about returning the Tesla I have. I l love the car but the company itself is a mess. I'm going to hire a lawyer this week and sue them.",-0.9145,0.104,0.848,0.047,Negative,Tesla
2,"During my first time I went into the San Francisco Tesla for service, the technician was able to identify the issues. 1. My car's trunk opened in the middle of the freeway.2. My car was making weird noises when making full turns.However, there were no loaners and my service adviser Sheri offers me $100/day Uber credits for commute or reschedule for an appointment. My daily commute is about 40miles to work one way and it would cost more than $100/day to take Uber, so I did not want to take that option. Sheri promised me if I reschedule for 2 weeks later, she will guarantee a loaner for me. She even puts that on the notes for my next appointment to reserve a vehicle with carpool lane sticker for me. Two weeks later, I went in for my rescheduled appointment and Sheri told me there is no loaner, so she will give me Uber credits. I told her the only reason for the reschedule was because you did not have a loaner for me 2 weeks ago and you guaranteed me you will get me one this time. Are you saying there were no one returning a loaner for the past 2 weeks? Sheri replied with ""Nothing can be guarantee. We can only give you Uber credits."" I was unhappy but unwilling to take another day off to go in for service because they do not open on weekends. I even took Uber screenshots and showed her my one way trip goes over $100 each way. I ended up taking other transportation to work that week after spending all the Uber credits.On a Friday, Sheri told me the car is fixed and they could deliver the car back to my house for free. I said I will take that service please. I asked her about what was done to the car and she informed me about the service. The trunk parts were replaced for free and they found debris inside my rotors that were causing the noises. And because they did not have to replace any parts for the turning issue, it means Tesla is not at fault and the charge would be $195. I disagreed with the charge because my car is only a year old and warranty should cover for the problem. She then ignores me and would not reply to my calls or texts. There were no communication at all and the car was not delivered to my house that Friday. On the next Monday, I called in and text her again in the morning. She ignores me again... I am going to assume she has a hangover or something so she could not go to work on Monday. I went into SF myself to get my car(Uber credits expired on Saturday), so I am paying to drive there even though they are suppose to deliver me the car on Friday. I talked to the first guy I saw and his name is David. He helped me cover the $195 using my warranty because they did find issues with the car creating the noise and my car is only a year old. Hence, I am giving this review a 2 stars because David is very nice and professional.",0.9431,0.044,0.888,0.068,Positive,Tesla
3,"Aside from my strong feelings as a usability researcher that the Tesla 3's UI is terrible if not dangerous for people driving a car (the primary job of this piece of metal), this dealership was meh in convincing me I should go for it against my better judgment. Ha! Context: I actually am looking for a new car. The 3 is within the price range we'd consider and I can charge for free at work and get valet parking. Given regular parking at work is like a daily re-enactment of lord of the flies, i could be swayed to fork over extra to regain 15 minutes of sanity in the morning. Pros: Sexy cars, obviously. I can charge said sexy car at work and save a bundle. Cute kid area to entertain your small dependents while waiting for a test drive. The 3 and its luxurious counterparts are up for playing with in the showroom. Cons: In the middle of the bleeping city. If you're looking for a test drive, a block away in either direction is a busy street. If you wanted to test the vehicle for zippiness or speed I challenge you to find a driver adjacent to you who will give you the space. I'd recommend going to another dealership in any quieter area where you can actually exercise any speedy attributes this car has. Keep in mind as other reviews have mentioned, you're responsible for damages (or at least that's what the signoff states, and the guy who handed me the keycard asked if I had insurance). The people working there act like you should know all the expected esoteric shit these cars want you to do. Why do you think I'm here seeing this thing in person? No, really, tell me how to turn off this stupid ho ho ho Santa mode crap because the instructions on screen are actually not working (what other controls are inaccurate here?). Disorganized way of setting up test drives. We must have been there for 45 minutes having talked to a guy early on who said ok we are good to get the next drive available. Next, we find out we had to sign in etc and need to now wait for everyone else in the queue for longer. Given how disorganized the place was I can't imagine what getting service for these vehicles is like, given the fact you can't really go elsewhere. Sounds appealing.... They call us a few days later asking if we're ready to buy one. Like literally in the first minute of the convo. Nope nope nope!! Rather stay in my 2009 Honda hooptie with the paint peeling off. Fix your UI and your attitude and I'd consider it.",0.9826,0.055,0.821,0.124,Positive,Tesla

5,"Love the technology. Hate the service. The person I worked with are rude, condescending.They never called me to tell me my car was ready. When I called into inquire about the status, I was put on hold for 14 minutes. No check in during that time I was on the phone, just made me hold the entire time.When I arrive to pick up the car, I gave them my name and the color and model number of my car. The representative checking for my car kept on typing on the computer, it seemed like he could not find my car. Important note, my car was towed in from Tesla roadside service. It seems like he could not find my car on the system, so I asked ""is was my car here?"" And he replied ""don't jump to conclusions, I will find your car. ""I replied, ""I'm not jumping to conclusions, I'm just inquiring if you have my car.""He then showed me to their waiting room and seemed very upset. At this point I still did not know if they had my car.I noticed he was on the phone and talking to multiple people outside the glass door waiting room. Eventually, I saw him drive my Model 3 into the service center. He motioned me over to my car. Still unhappy with the communication during this service pick up, I asked what his name was. He said ""John"". I asked, ""John, what is your last name?"". He replied ""Smith"".",-0.2853,0.058,0.883,0.06,Neutral,Tesla

He refused to give his name (had to ask his co-workers for the name) He was just yelling at me, telling me that he doesn't like me, refusing to help and asking me to call him Rambo if I want to?! This was my second interaction with him, and it's horrible. He actually told me that he will call security on me because I asked his co-workers about his name. What a shame! I truly like Tesla but leaving people like him to work makes me hate that place.Don't go there unless you really have to.

7,"I had an excellent car shopping experience at this dealership, which operates far above and beyond the average semi-predatory car dealership. I experienced low to no pressure, as the salesperson - Renee - let the car sell itself. There is no negotiating on price, which takes a little away from being able to enjoy a sense of fighting for a good deal, but it was also a relief to forgo all of the preparatory research, intense negotiations, and the inevitable and exhausting rounds of, ""Let me see what my manager thinks."" You don't have to commit an entire day of your life to buy a car from this dealership; the process is straightforward, streamlined and fast. Everyone I spoke with was pleasant, helpful and friendly, a welcome change from the stressed out faces and clipped responses I've experienced at other dealerships when dealing with anyone other than my salesperson. Sales is a difficult and honorable profession, and it's always a pleasure to see it done right, as it is at this dealership.",0.9726,0.102,0.705,0.194,Positive,Tesla

9,"We had an extremely negative experience at Tesla. After our test drive and leaving the show room, I was called and told we were liable for $200 for ""tire damage."" After speaking with a manager I was then emailed a charge for $250. No explanation or photo of tire damage, reason, etc..I wish I had looked at similar reviews about the liability agreements and similar charges before test driving. The entire experience left us with a very negative feeling about Tesla and the Van Ness location in particular.

10,"The service center here is TERRIBLE. I had a tire that needed to be patched and the target time of 10:30am passed with zero updates. I tried texting back, calling, emailing, logging onto the website to chat per the instructions on their voicemail (there was no chat function available) and it was a black hole with no one picking up the phone. I finally called Sales and was simply transferred to the number that NO ONE was picking up over the course of 3 hours. The second time I called Sales and explained the issue they walked over to talk to someone in Service and I finally got a call back saying my car would be ready at 2pm at the latest. I showed up at 2:30pm and my car was. not. ready. I raised the issue when I was there and they simply said the text service must be down. Yeah, I know because I told my service rep that I had texted him back and he said he didn't get it and said the same thing but what are you going to do to fix/escalate it?? Nothing was done about it. Service was a sh*t show, DON'T COME HERE. On top of this, they changed the service that was agreed without telling me, and only informed me when I paid. Four days later and Corporate still hasn't responded to my original messages. Extremely disappointed in Tesla. Made me realize that you are paying $$$ money without the equivalent service you would expect from any other established dealership and questioning whether I should be a Tesla owner. If you have a similar issue, I was informed that you can file with the Bureau of Automotive Repair bar.ca.gov/Consumer/Auto….

11,"Finally my model x is ready after three month wait and I was under the assumption that since I ordered the car in the Corte Madera showroom, I would be picking it up there, but I was told I have to either go to the Van Ness showroom or Fremont. Then I asked if I can have a ride from Marin to the showroom and was told I need to get there with my own transportation. I asked my friend to drive me and called on my way to see where we should park since my friend wanted to go in with me and check out the car, this time I was told to find my own parking on the street or just park at the amc theater. Pick up experience is ok, a bit rushed but seems like they just want to get you out of the door as soon as possible. Not very well organized... and they always answer my questions with it will take 24 hours to work or just call customer service and they will help you with that. Lastly before we left, I asked if they have any key chain to give me and was told they are out of it and have no idea when they will be getting it. Didn't even offer to send me one when they have it back in stock. I am not sure this is the way they doing business all across the country but if I am buying a 100k plus car they should at least try to provide some basic amenities like a pick up service and at least a free key chain or two. When I bought my s class two years ago, they delivered my car via tow truck to my house and throw in many free items like rubber floor mats, key chains and license plate frames. Not impressed at all, hope they will improve.",0.9876,0.033,0.836,0.131,Positive,Tesla

They have a nice waiting area with lots of seating, a few tables, water and coffee. They also have a little kids area for them to play. When you get service, ask for a loaner car. You may or may not get a replacement Tesla, but at least you'll get a car :) They also have security here making sure no one can just walk in to use the restrooms if they are not a customer.

13,"Scheduled a service appointment a month in advanced for my Model S' broken door handle and general maintenance. A week leading up to the scheduled appointment, the back triangular window got broken into and I added that into the notes on the Tesla portal in case that the shop takes more than a week to fix (I actually had it fixed at a local shop in less than a day). I later received a text from Tesla saying my appointment had been canceled because they don't service cars with broken windows. No one even bothered to double-check with me.TLDR; Be very careful about what notes you enter for your appointment. They are trigger-happy and will cancel your appointment without verifying anything with you.Not a 1-star review because the Jeremy, the Tesla rep. whom I was voicing this concern to did an excellent job trying to resolve the issue.

14,"My experience with Tesla has kind of stunk. This review isn't regarding the actual cars (which still seem cool to me) but my experience with the dealership and Tesla as an overall organization. There's just been endless chaos and frustration since I decided to get my car. Deliveries getting cancelled on multiple occasions, miscommunications (I'm going to assume the best and say that people aren't outright lying to me). The most egregious thing is that it's been incredibly difficult to get a hold of anyone. I'll talk to someone on Monday and by Wednesday, that person's number has changed or their voicemail is full and there's essentially no way to get a hold of them. I've spent hours (that's not an exaggeration) on hold with customer service, only to be promised a call back from a manager that doesn't happen. Anyways, you get the point. Dealing with Tesla stinks right now. Maybe it's just a logistical hell they're going through and only temporary. Who knows, but unless you're desperate to get an electric car right now, I would recommend holding off or at least going through another dealer.",-0.9315,0.147,0.765,0.088,Negative,Tesla

Well the first e-mail was a month ago and the last 10 days ago and still no response. I have had trouble getting help in the past and my feeling now is perhaps I should have waited for a more established company to come out with a comparable car as it is apparent that Tesla and Elan Musk have no clue about customer service.

I left work and once there I was told they are too busy and can't service the vehicle! They added that I can come back between 3-5pm or buy the tire from the tire shop across the street! Wow, that is an a-class service for a $100k+ vehicle! From service experience in both San Francisco and Burlingame over the past two years, I came to conclude that I made a terrible mistake buying a Tesla.

Then come to the realization that you have to put on some MMA gear to go spar with the liars at the car dealerships? Well, that's what almost happened to me. Until I found Roadster - a car broker that allows you to purchase your new car online. That's right folks. As Vince Vaughn would say ""On the line."" Welcome to 2017.Roadster's website is fantastic. User interface is simple and gets right to the point. Pick out your make, model, and options, and it gives you an estimate of your total cost. Cash, finance, lease. Doesn't matter. A broker is a must if you have a particular set of options and want no more, no less. Like me. I ""needed"" a new Honda Accord. But I only wanted the Sport model, and only in white pearl, AND only with a manual transmission. I did my own homework - there were only 2 in the entire state of CA. One in Norcal, the other in SoCal. Did Roadster pull it off? You bet they did.Roadster partners with thousands of dealers, but they can't have relationships with each one. So, if the car you want is not in their network, they go to bat for you and do some sort of underground car dealer trading that we're not privy to. Which is what happened in my case. Try that solo.My experience - Monday night, I go to Roadster's website, pick out my car with only the options I want. Tuesday morning, I start getting emails from Kim explaining the process. I put down $100 of the $295 broker fee. I complete info for credit app. Tuesday afternoon - they start the search. Find one of two. They start pleading and begging (sort of) on my behalf with their partners/dealers. Wednesday - they continue to broker my transaction, and come to terms. Some kind of barter takes place. Thursday - the exact car I selected online gets driven from San Jose up to my neighborhood dealer in the Tri-Valley and gets prepped. I get an email from Kim saying to expect deliver in the afternoon. Thursday 3pm, Mike drives a white Accord sport stick shift into my driveway. Goes over the car. We sit down. He presents lease docs. And 10 minutes later. D-U-N done.  I last leased a truck about 2 years ago, and I'm not ishing you...spent about 8 hours there over the span of 2 days just negotiating.

End result, within 1 week (last week) I took delivery of my new 2017 Audi A4 Premium Plus Quattro! And as of a few hours ago, I said good riddance to my current lease with a buyout for the exact payoff amount from Roadster. In all seriousness, Roadster honestly takes the crap factor out of the whole car buying experience. I'm happy that I found them when I did because I was able to appreciate what was presented to me. This was a lease, so the math can be tricky so as long as you do your homework, you can tell if your getting a good deal or not. I was able to confirm the exact breakdown of the lease before committing to anything. Knowing the mf and residual for an exact model is critical. So do your homework. After researching the legitimacy of the company, I started the process online. Less than 24 hrs later, I got a call and it was history from there.  I can't stress enough about how freaking convenient it was using a broker / car buying service to do the dirty work for you. My wife almost passed out when she heard she didn't have to go into a dealership. I saved roughly 10% off MSRP and with Audi that's pretty good. Coupled with not having to spar with the salesman and his ""manager"", it's priceless. I do want to say thank you to both Mark (who took care of the purchase) and Jay (who handled the trade in).

34,"I discovered Roadster (now BuySideAuto) through RealCarTips.com after Googling car buying advice. RealCarTips is a trusted step-by-step resource to negotiate new car prices with dealerships, so for them to recommend BuySideAuto is already a big plus. Once you narrow down the vehicle of your choice, go to BuySideAuto's website to get an immediate express price. Their web interface is very user friendly and I often find myself checking real car prices just out of curiosity, as no sign up is required and even when you sign up, they don't spam or push/annoy you. I was specifically interested in a 2018 white Honda Accord Hybrid Base, and wouldn't settle for any other colors, trims, or options. This hybrid model was just released in April 2018, and dealerships were barely getting any stock, but somehow BuySideAuto was able to secure one for me in mid-May 2018 at near dealership invoice price (which RealCarTips always tries to push you to reach), not the MSRP/sticker price! And to put that into perspective, my out-the-door (after taxes/fees) cost was almost the sticker price!When I tried searching all the local Bay Area Honda dealerships, no one would barely consider any haggling on the price because the vehicle was so new. I checked to see if there would be any new Honda holiday incentives because Memorial Day was coming up, but nope, no manufacturer rebates/discounts for hybrid models. I compared all the websites like TrueCar, Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, Carjojo, Cars, and Consumer Reports for real-time quotes, but none offered any real deals, other than like only $500 off. I bought my last car through TrueCar in 2012 but their pricing has gone downhill and isn't as competitive as when that company first started. I finally reached out to BuySideAuto (Kim) and she mentioned that the longer I wait and the closer it gets to the holidays, that specific model (color and trim) would likely sell out and I may have to wait for dealerships to re-stock. I jumped on it, filled out some online forms on Thursday afternoon, and after a few calls and emails, Kim somehow secured the deal and I was in my brand new car the next day on Friday at noon! She was very detailed in her responses, kept me up-to-date throughout the entire buying process with the dealership, and was very transparent about the pricing and how they were able to secure a good deal. Chris delivered the car to my work (but you can get it delivered to your home or elsewhere) and just like at the dealership, he went through the car-specific features and walkthroughs, along with signing and explaining the finance paperwork. The advantage of the delivery service is not only for convenience, but so you don't have to sit through any last-minute dealer negotiations (like options, packages, warranty, etc.). Cheers to Kim and Chris for pulling this through in less than 24 hours, and for sure securing a better deal (even after factoring the broker fee) than I would have ever been able to.

48,"Been meaning to leave this review for awhile as a warning to the community...In June 2019, my spouse and I went to Albany Subaru (the used lot in El Cerrito) for an Outback, my dream car. Our salesperson was a young guy who'd told us this was his first month on the job, still learning the ropes--hadn't made a sale yet. During the test drive, he couldn't tell us much about the specific car's history or the model, but was very sweet, personable, and accommodating. The car drove great. We got back to the lot, spent some time sitting in the car, did some additional research, and felt pretty much set to make the purchase. We just wanted to take a look at a mechanic's report.Around this point, another dealer who was ""mentoring"" the younger one took the reins. As we started to fill out some preliminary paperwork for my credit check, we made repeated (polite but firm) requests to see the mechanic's report. He seemed pretty hesitant to show us anything and kept hemming and hawing about how all their cars are inspected and have to pass certain standards to even be sold. We insisted anyway. Finally, they produced an ""in-house"" report from the parts and services department that looked all clear... Thank goodness we were wise enough to follow some family advice and get the car inspected by an independent mechanic as well, before signing a contract.At this point the younger dealer was feeling very proud to be making his first sale, and offered to pay for the independent inspection. We felt very endeared to him and were excited to be part of this moment in his career. Our trust in the business was bolstered by his offer as well.This is where things got ugly. We took the car up San Pablo to a very nice Midas mechanic. We waited a few minutes. The moment he put the car up on the lift, he beckoned us over to come see. The car had a huge, deep scrape down the center of its undercarriage. He explained that the damage to various parts was worth at least $3000 in parts, if not more, and that the car would probably break down very soon on the road without the necessary repairs. It seemed like it had been driven over a tell parking block or something similar. So that was that. We called the younger dealer. He was ashen-faced when we showed him the Midas mechanic's report. It was clear at that point-- after he'd paid for the $150 inspection and demonstrated real surprise and disappointment at its result-- that he was not clued into the true condition of the car.We got back to the lot and tried to call out the other dealer. He basically was not able to give us a straight answer about why his mechanic's report was inaccurate. He said it had been done that morning (the car had just arrived to them the day before), so there was little chance that it had been driven over something since entering the hands of the dealership. We couldn't get him to explain and aspect of the discrepancy between the two mechanics' reports.Because, like I said, the Outback is my dream car, I offered to buy the car anyway at a discount equal to the repairs, and they flat-out refused. They said, ""We don't do that kind of thing."" I checked back on the car listing over the following weeks and the price didn't budge at all. Clearly they were planning to try to scam someone else in a similar way.So, the used sales department gets 1 star for being dishonest (or incompetent), as well as being unkind to their young employee.",0.9943,0.058,0.809,0.133,Positive,Subaru

There are several pros and cons of this dealership based upon our experience here in comparison to other dealerships.Pros:- Cars are competitively priced. I don't believe we could have gotten this type of deal at any other dealership.- The gentlemen we talked to are easy-going and approachable. There is no stereotypical car dealership sales pressure here. If you like a car, you can present an offer and they will run it by their managers. If you don't like a vehicle you can walk away and not be bothered again.-Regardless of age or condition, they will give you the most credit they can on any vehicle you would like to trade in. Cons: -The cars for sale are not clean. When we went to initially test drive the vehicle there was some dust on the interior as well as a grocery store receipt in the trunk. When we returned to purchase the vehicle a month or so later, there was even more debris/dust all over the interior and the grocery store receipt was still there!.-The employees use the cars for personal use! When I noticed the car was still available, I sent my dad to go take a look at the vehicle however it was not on the lot! When we asked where the car was, we were told it was out ""being serviced."" Turns out the ""servicing,"" led to an additional 1,000 miles being put on the vehicle from when we initially viewed it.-They do not invest in any of the trade-ins they get.

They made us wait for almost 5 hours because they were fixing the papers of the car and they took so long. Okay so fastforward, it was very late when we took the car home but we were really happy. The next day I noticed that the car has so many defects. The seats weren't clean, cheap and dusty lookin seats. The rear bumper was falling down, even the arm rest on the side door was broken. We came back for the bumper and they changed the clip and I just got pissed coz how would you sell a freaking car for 15,000$ with all these defects like tf. And 3 weeks after we got the car, we already needed to get the wheels aligned and get the break pads changed smh",-0.975,0.162,0.776,0.062,Negative,Auto Deals
69,"I am currently updating my review of autoland/autodeals. I initially posted my review 3 months ago of my experience with this dealership and it was not the best. joe H seen my review and wanted to do right by me. I contacted him and he told me to swing by the dealer and that he would make it right and so he did. Although the problem was very small, he made it right by me and for that I give him 5 stars. He is very professional and puts customer service above all things. Now with my new experience I would definitely come back for more business.",-0.5216,0.058,0.916,0.026,Negative,Auto Deals

72,"I had the best experience today working with Jo (the owner) on purchasing our new 2015 Rav4 with only 23K miles! They never pressured us in making a decision and got us a great deal! Their moto is ""we make it happen"" and they sure do! When he asked us straight away what our plan/goal was, he worked hard to make sure we walked away happy with an awesome low monthly payment! His team of associates were really friendly and helpful while we were in the lot looking around. I highly recommend anyone to check this place out first before going anywhere else!",0.9852,0.028,0.692,0.28,Positive,Auto Deals

77,"Got sold a limon, even after the fact that i have previously purchased a car with them and had an amazing experience and a great relationship with this dealer. My second purchase with them My transmission went out on a 2010 Chevy equinox a month after I bought it. It was a hassle to have them help me fix it so I ended up just letting it go. After putting $2500 down to purchase the truck and multiple transmission shops saying the repair would cost me $5000 or more. I should of just bought a used car in cash instead of getting a repo on my credit and a loss of $2500 out of my pocket.",0.8979,0.02,0.863,0.116,Positive,Auto Deals
